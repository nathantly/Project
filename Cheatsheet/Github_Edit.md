Some basics Github formatting syntax:
## Headings
Simply put # at the beginning of the sentence.
(#) is the biggest
(######) is the smallest

## Styling text
**Bold**        **  **   

*Italic*        *  *

~~Strikee through~~     ~~   ~~

<Subscript>       <   >

## Quoting text
Using >

Text that is not quoted
> Text that is quoted

## Quoting code
Using single backticks \`   \` to `quote` within a sentence
or using \```(Programming language - optional)   ``` to quote multiple sentences

```
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push
```

## Link
Create a link by wrap the text in `[]` and link in `()` 
`Check out my linkedin profile [Nathanly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-ly-93ba2b180/)`

Check out my linkedin profile [Nathanly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-ly-93ba2b180/)

## Section links
Instruction unclear...

## Relative links
Same as normal link but we replace the path of the file/image in Github

`Check out me Volcab file [Volcab](../Volcab.md)`

Check out me Volcab file [Volcab](../Volcab.md)

## Images
Adding `!` then `[]` then `()`
Ex: `![JP Lobster](../assests/jplobster.jpeg)`
![JP Lobster](../assests/jplobster.jpeg)

### Specifying the themes
by adding `#gh-dark-mode-only` or `#gh-light-mode-only


## Lists, nested lists

Order `number.`
